<CHANGES>
###&version;
- Replaced ‚ÄúMin PWM‚Äù with Fan Speed Range to allow setting both minimum and maximum fan speed
- UI now automatically converts PWM values to 0‚Äì100%, with tooltips showing both % and raw PWM for reference
- Added fallback protection: if input field is left empty, Fan Speed Range will default to 40%‚Äì100%.
- Combined Low/High Temp fields into a single Temperature Range row for better usability
- Added fallback protection: if input field is left empty, Temperature Range will default to 40¬∞C‚Äì60¬∞C.
- Unit labels (%, ¬∞C, min) are now consistently shown in input fields for clarity
- New Identify section allows assigning or removing labels for PWM controllers (replaces the old Pause 30s buttons)
- If an unlabeled PWM is selected in a fan configuration, the Identify popup will automatically open for labeling
- Added Syslog On/Off setting to reduce log noise for fan configurations where logging is not needed (enabled by default)
- Syslog list now updates in real time to match the fan configuration order
- Introduced a Help &amp; Tips section for inline guidance and explanations
- Improved UI layout, tooltips, placeholders, and ‚ÄúHow to Use‚Äù descriptions
- **Fixed** temperature reading failures on certain SSDs and non-standard drives.
- **Fixed** missing cache pool grouping for XFS/BTRFS drives in Include Disks selector.

###1.2.4
- Added "Run Now" button in UI and Dashboard
- Reorder fan blocks with drag-and-drop support
- Include Disk(s) shown as "Selected X Disks" with tooltip
- Input validation for Custom Name and Interval
- Confirm before deleting fan configuration
- Dashboard fan order synced with UI
- Minor bug fixes and UI improvements

###1.2.3
- This version adds Dashboard tile support for Unraid:
- Displays each fan‚Äôs current temperature, RPM, and status.
- Indicates whether the main daemon is running.
- Supports both enabled and disabled fans (shown as Active or Inactive).

###1.2.2
- The top green/red status dot is now rendered using CSS for consistent styling and visibility.
- Each fan block now includes a live SVG icon to indicate control status (Active / Inactive), with automatic rotation and color changes based on running state. 
- When clicking the Stop button, any fan that was actively controlled will be set to 50% PWM in manual mode. This helps prevent full-speed ramp-ups or complete fan stalls when BIOS fails to take over.
- Fixed excessive log writes in earlier versions.
- Minor UI alignment and layout improvements.

###1.2.1
- fanctrlplus v1.2.1 introduces small but useful improvements. The "Pause 30s" button now shows a proper countdown and restores automatically after 30 seconds, improving user feedback. Additionally, disks in the dropdown list are now sorted more intuitively, with "Parity" and "Parity 2" correctly shown before "Disk 1", "Disk 2", etc.    
- This version mainly improves UI clarity and minor fan control behavior.

###1.2.0
- Improved disk selection UI: "Include Disks" dropdown now shows full device labels (Parity, Disk 1~N, pool devices), grouped and labeled as in Unraid Main.
- Dynamic disk rendering: Disks are listed using JavaScript for better performance. Hover to show full device path and ID. Flash excluded.
- UI enhancements: Faster load, smoother operation, updated structure.
- Minor bug fixes and code cleanup.

###1.1.1
- Added individual fan status indicators to each fan fieldset (üü¢ Running / üî¥ Stopped), synced with backend daemon per fan config
- Moved Delete button to bottom-right corner of each fan section for improved layout clarity
- Introduced backend support for status_all to report individual config status to the UI
- Improved handling of .pid file names by sanitizing custom names (trimming whitespace, avoiding hidden characters)
- Added consistent title tooltips to all input/select fields
- Changed all field labels to use cursor: help and direct tooltips instead of floating icons
- Updated Custom Name placeholder to Required (e.g. HDDBay) and enforced it as a required field
- Improved form validation UX: empty Custom Name now shows tooltip and prevents submission
- Preserved clean layout in both light and dark themes without visual misalignment
- Minor UI refinements for spacing, font consistency, and field alignment

###.1.1.0
- Introduced a more reliable daemon control mechanism by moving fan logic to a standalone .sh script for improved stability.
- The UI now fully supports Start, Stop, and Status operations with better feedback and reliability.
- Added .sh backend for a stable fan control loop.
- Start/Stop button and running status indicator now fully functional.
- Improved reliability of temperature detection and fan response.

###1.0.3
- Added status indicator showing Running or Stopped
- Combined Start/Stop into a single toggle button
- Fixed missing log entry when stopping the daemon
- Moved control buttons (Add Fan, Apply, Start/Stop) to the bottom of the page
- Relocated status text to appear under the page title

###1.0.2
- Replaced new rc.fanctrlplus

###1.0.1
- New icon with transparent background
- Removed all Chinese messages from syslog
- Excluded Unraid USB flash boot device from disk selection
- Improved multi-PWM support and runtime stability

###1.0.0
- Initial public release.
- Control multiple PWM fans based on disk/NVMe temperatures.
- Per-fan config, Pause/Identify fan, smart logging.
- Web UI for configuration and disk selection.
- Configurations persist across reboots.
