# **FanCtrl Plus**

**FanCtrl Plus** is an Unraid plugin that provides automatic fan control based on the temperatures of HDDs, NVMe drives, and Unassigned Devices.
Each fan can be assigned to specific drives, with a temperature range (Low ~ High) that defines how the fan speed scales linearly using a simple control algorithm.
Configuration is done through intuitive fan blocks with per-fan thresholds, intervals, and labeling support.

## ‚ú® Features

- Full-featured Web UI for configuration and monitoring
- Supports temporary fan configuration with safe validation and custom naming
- Automatically starts with the Unraid array for hands-free operation
- Set custom thresholds and intervals per fan
- Control multiple PWM fans independently
- Monitor temps from array disks, NVMe, and unassigned devices
‚Äì Uses a linear control algorithm to smoothly adjust fan speed (PWM) based on the current disk temperature between your defined low/high values
- Identify and label PWM controllers to match physical fans easily
- Dashboard tile and system integration
- Drag and drop fan configuration boxes to reorder them as you like. The new order is saved and reflected in both the UI and Dashboard.
