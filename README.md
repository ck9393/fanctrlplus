# **FanCtrl Plus**

FanCtrl Plus is an Unraid plugin that provides automatic fan control based on the temperatures of HDDs, NVMe drives, and Unassigned Devices.
You can assign specific fans to specific drives, define low/high temperature thresholds, and the fan speed will scale **automatically and linearly** between them using a simple control algorithm.

## ‚ú® Features

- Web UI for full configuration
- Temp config support with custom naming and safe validation
- Automatically starts with the Unraid array for hands-free operation
- Control multiple PWM fans independently
- Monitor temps from array disks, NVMe, and unassigned devices
‚Äì Uses a linear control algorithm to smoothly adjust fan speed (PWM) based on the current disk temperature between your defined low/high values
- Set custom thresholds and intervals per fan
- Pause/Identify‚Äù fan for easy hardware matching
- Dashboard tile and system integration
- Drag and drop fan configuration boxes to reorder them as you like. The new order is saved and reflected in both the UI and Dashboard.
